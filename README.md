# 4WD safety systems

This is a university project for creating a microcontroller program, that adds safety functionalities to an electric vehicle such as an electric skateboard. This 3rd-semester project is being done at Aalborg University Esbjerg on the Applied Industrial Engineering study program.

## Usage

The project is developed using platform.io, and is tested on an ESP32-C3-MINI-1 microprocessor.

## Features

It is planned to add the following safety features to the setup:
- Logging motor properties like rpm and current load
- Detecting unsafe conditions, like slipping, sliding, brake blocking, etc.
- Modifying motor controls in order to return to safe driving conditions
- These systems can be
  - ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)
  - ASC (Automatic Stability Control)
  - TCS (Traction Control System)
  - Torque vectoring
  - Speed wobble prevention system
